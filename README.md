<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


POE is a prediction poll that leverages the collective wisdom of its users to make predictions about future events.
It fosters a collaborative environment, where users are motivated to exchange their insights and reasoning behind their estimates.

At the heart of POE is an advanced scoring mechanism that records users' prediction accuracy over time, assigning greater 
significance to individuals with a consistent history of precise forecasts. This system is enhanced by integrating temporal decay, 
which prioritizes recent contributions, and recalibration techniques to refine the aggregation of user estimates.

### Why POE?

POE presents a compelling alternative to traditional prediction markets, potentially surpassing them in accuracy of forecasts. 
While both POE and prediction markets aggregate forecasts to anticipate future events, their underlying motivations and reward systems reveal distinct values.

Prediction markets operate through the buying and selling of contracts based on future events, with the primary objective of price determination. 
Here, participants aim to maximize their profits rather than to seek truth. This profit-driven nature can sometimes incentivize manipulation over genuine prediction, 
especially when high rewards are at stake.

Conversely, POE is grounded in the pursuit of a deeper understanding of the world. It encourages participants to seek the truth, 
fostering a community where the collective goal is enlightenment, not monetary gain. Research supports that prediction polls equipped 
with appropriate scoring feedback, collaborative capabilities, and sophisticated statistical aggregation methods can serve as a more 
effective mechanism for harnessing the wisdom of crowds than traditional prediction markets.

By launching as a large-scale experiment on the Solana blockchain, POE aspires not only to challenge the efficacy of existing prediction markets 
but to redefine the standards for decision-making tools. Through its innovative approach, POE aims to become the definitive source for accurate predictions, 
leveraging the collective intelligence of its users to illuminate the future.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] Build a community of truth seeker  
- [ ] Create user profiles and chat function
- [ ] Expand polls to predict values like amount, date, prices, etc
- [ ] Enable private polls
- [ ] Provide material to offer newcomers a chance to learn and practice the skill of forecasting
- [ ] Provide computational resources and infrastructure for users to run their models and automate their predictions
