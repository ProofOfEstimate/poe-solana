<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

We are on a mission to build a scalable and stable prediction market that empowers better decision-making and fosters a more equitable financial ecosystem. By addressing the inherent flaws in traditional markets—such as front-running and liquidity constraints—we are paving the way for futarchy experiments and innovative governance models that could reshape organizations and societies alike.


<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## How it works

#### Belief-Based Trading Mechanism
Participants submit their subjective probabilities about future events (e.g., "75% chance that Event A will happen").

#### Fair Market Price Aggregation
We aggregate all user-submitted probabilities to determine a real-time, fair market price. 

#### Dynamic Asset Streaming
Assets are continuously streamed to users based on the latest market price. This real-time adjustment keeps your positions aligned with the most current information, maximizing fairness and responsiveness.


## Why Poe?

Our platform is more than an innovative trading venue; it's a significant advancement for DeFi:

#### Eliminating Front-Running
By removing the traditional order book and enabling continuous price recalculations, we prevent front-running and ensure a level playing field for all users.

#### Enhancing Scalability and Liquidity
Every participant inherently acts as a market maker. This unique model can scale to global demand.

#### Enabling Futarchy and Better Governance:
By providing a reliable and expressive prediction market, we support futarchy experiments where policy decisions are guided by market predictions, leading to more informed and effective governance.

<!-- ROADMAP
## Roadmap

- [ ] Build a community of truth seeker  
- [ ] Create user profiles and chat function
- [ ] Expand polls to predict values like amount, date, prices, etc
- [ ] Enable private polls
- [ ] Provide material to offer newcomers a chance to learn and practice the skill of forecasting
- [ ] Provide computational resources and infrastructure for users to run their models and automate their predictions
